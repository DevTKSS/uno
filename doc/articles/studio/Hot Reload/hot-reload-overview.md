# Hot Reload Overview

The Uno Platform **Hot Reload** feature provides a way to modify the XAML and C# of your running application, in order to iterate faster on UI or code changes. This makes the inner developer loop faster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later (`net9.0` in the `TargetFrameworks` property) is required for Hot Reload to be available when your solution contains iOS, Android, Mac Catalyst, or WebAssembly project heads. On Windows, [Visual Studio 17.12](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) or later is required.
